        description:"India is one of the fastest-growing economies, with a booming infrastructure industry, as witnessed in the last two decades. Workers equally dominate the Indian construction industry, along with automation. They form the backbone of the construction business in India. The geographical and cultural variation inside India is more than in any other country. Despite these variations in India, the workers migrate from one place to another for work. Sometimes workers also move along with the employer from one project to another in different construction project sites. The relationship between the construction manager's leadership style and the work-life balance of construction workers for the Indian construction industry is still unexplored. There may be variations in leadership style due to cultural and geographical variations, which may affect construction workers' work-life balance. Thus, this study analyses the importance and relationship between the leadership style and the workers' work-life balance.",

IOT gain momentum in the construction industry in the past few decades, which has effectively been used in manufacturing sectors. While some studies have reviewed the development in these two domains separately (construction Industry and IOT), they did not address the important associations between them, nor did they analyze their joint advancement over time. Therefore, this study aims to understand and quantitatively analyze the dynamic evolution of relationships between them which satisfy the construction industry's growing needs.",
